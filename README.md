PSM Evaluator
-------------

Typically proteomic search engines produce a single number used to
rank each peptide-spectrum-match. The purpose of this tool is to allow
re-evaluation of these matches using any number of flexiable criteria
chosen by the user in a search engine independent manner.

The goal to reduce a large number of PSMs to a smaller number of PSMs
the researcher is more confident about, perhaps as a precursor to
manual visual validation or additional experimentation.
